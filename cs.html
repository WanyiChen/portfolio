      <p>This is my first design project. Notably, it was my first coding project as well. I did not learn computer science in high school. When I first came across computer science in college and immediately became interested in it, I suddenly
        wondered why I had not known it earlier. That tiny curiosity soon grew stronger and stronger. In fall 2016, I did an independent study with Prof. Ryan Shaw in the School of Information and Library Science to study CS education in U.S. and
        Chinese high schools. Then, after all the research and literature review, I had some interesting insights and wrote a paper. Yet after that, I was like, “So what?”</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="http://cs-wanyi02.cloudapps.unc.edu/">The website</a> was an attempt to answer the “so what” question. Few people like reading academic papers, so I wanted to present my research in a different, hopefully more
        engaging and
        personalized way. I wanted the website to have a “low floor
        and high ceiling”: it should be easily to explore in order to reach a boarder audience, yet it should also offer more content for those who want to know more. Those were my design challenges.
      </p>
      <h2 id="1">The Initial Design</h2>
      <p>To meet the "low floor and high ceiling" requirement, I had the "read more" and "show less" feature for all my content. Based on the website's topic, I also wanted to create more personalized contents based on the users nationality (U.S.,
        China) and occupation (teacher, student, policy maker, other). I was influenced by the concept of "action journalism":
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alana-moceri/journalism-for-action_b_5059893.html">action journalism</a> seeks to not only provide readers with information, but also enable users to take actions based on the
        information. So I seeked to provide ways for different people to get involved in high school CS education. The initial
        wireframe was as follows:</p>
      <div class="image-wrap">
        <img width="100%" src="pic/cs-wireframe1.JPG">
    </div>
        <p>I wanted the "How can I get involved" bar at the footer to stand out, so I chose a contrasting background color. After the user clicks on the orange bar, the page will ask their nationality and occupation, and then it will display
          relevant
          content.</p>
        <h2 id="2">Poster as Prototype</h2>
        <p>The next step would be user testing. Right around that time, I got a chance to present a poster at my university's Celebration of Undergraduate Research event. There were a lot of firsts involved in this project: it was my first research
          poster presentation as well! I suddenly thought, "Why not use this chance to do some user testing?" So I
          designed my poster as a paper prototype for my website.</p>
        <div class="image-wrap">
          <img width="100%" src="pic/cs-poster.jpg">
        </div>
          <p>If someone would ask about the "How can I get involved" part of the poster, that would be equivalent as clicking the orange bar on the website. I would then hand out a prepared flyer, which equaled the next page on the website. On the
            presentation day, many stopped by, but very few asked about "How can I get involved."</p>
          <p>The tricky part would be to figure out why. I asked for some help from my professors. One suggested that it wasn't apparent that the orange bar was clickable/actionable. Besides, people often ignore footers. It wasn't enough to use a
            contrasting background color. It was better for the part to stand out as a clearly clickable call-to-action button.</p>
          <h2 id="3">The Re-design</h2>
          <p>Engineers are often told to not reinvent the wheel. I came to learn that the same holds true for designers as well. For the next few days, I looked at political campaign websites and studied their call-to-action buttons. I then
            redesigned
            my website as follows:</p>
          <div class="image-wrap">
            <img width="100%" src="pic/cs-wireframe2.jpg">
        </div>
            <p>Now the orignal orange footer bar appeared as a item on the side bar menu. There were other reasons that I transformed the whole menu from a horizontal bar to a side bar. First, it could be hard to scan accross many items
              horizontally.
              Secondly, a side bar would make it easier to design and code for mobile (this was the wireframing before prototype testing, but the idea is that the side bar on the PC screen can be easily turned into the menu on the mobile screen):</p>
            <div class="image-wrap">
              <img width="100%" src="pic/cs-mobile.JPG">
            </div>
              <p>In the end, there was one more change. I directly placed the nationality and occupation questionaire on the side bar. This would save the users one click and make the part stand out even more. Below is a screenshot of the final
                website:</p>
              <div class="image-wrap">
                <img width="100%" src="pic/cs-final.png">
                </div>
                <p>And the mobile version (the menu expands upon user click):</p>
                <div class="image-wrap">
                  <img width="350px" src="pic/cs-mobile1.jpg">
                  <img width="350px" src="pic/cs-mobile2.jpg">
                  </div>
                  <h2 id="4">Looking Back</h2>
                  <p>I have said that the website was an attempt to answer the “so what” question. Looking back, was the attempt successful? Frankly, no. Building the website was one story, and actually reaching out to an audience was another. The
                    latter is also an important part, but far beyond the scope of engineering and design. It is much like the classical question asked in entrepreneurship, “If you build it, will they come?” The answer will not always be clear from
                    the
                    beginning. Yet since then, I came to think of research as a form of entrepreneurship.</p>
