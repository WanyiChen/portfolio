      <p>Hi there. I am Wanyi Chen, currently a software engineer at Audible. This is a place where I jot down my stories, thoughts and lessons learned from
        my continued journey into product design.</p>
      <p>I used to think that design was all about making things look pretty. Drawing and painting have been my hobbies since childhood. For a few months when I first began college, I was a Studio Arts major. I didn’t quite want to become a fulltime
        artist, so when I seriously considered future careers, naturally I thought about design.</p>
      <p>Then, I magically fell in love with Computer Science. Trying to blend my two passions, I excitedly signed up for a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course in my late sophomore year. The first reading was about different input methods for a
        smart TV, comparing their speed and rate of error, etc. It was full of painstaking details of experimental design and data. It had nothing to do with art. I was quite disappointed. There were other
        considerations too, but I ended up
        dropping the course.</p>
      <p>However, ever since then I slowly began to discover what design is really about. That HCI reading somehow stuck in my head and prompted me to observe the designs around me. Too often I observed people say that they were not “technically
        savvy” when they couldn’t figure out how to use some new product, when I knew it wasn’t their fault. It was just bad design. I study Computer Science to develop new technologies. But what good are new technologies if humans couldn’t figure
        out how to use them?</p>
      <p>That is where design can help. Good design is about making the product clear and easy to use so that using it feels intuitive even if the user has never interacted with it before. It is about deciding on the application logic to cut
        unnecessary steps and prioritize the important ones. It is about discovering what the real problems are and serving human’s needs first. Making things look pretty still matters, but that is the finishing touch.</p>
      <p>Since I discovered the value of design, I grabbed every opportunity I could to improve my design skills. I learned about wireframing from an information science class, persona techniques from a media school internship, and rapid prototyping
        from my entrepreneurship minor. I went to talks at conferences, read books and articles, and continued to observe everyday designs. I designed websites (PC and
        mobile), poster, watch app, and even a proposal for accessible ATM. I became more and more interested in human-centered design, and gradually discovered my strengths as an engineer-designer.</p>
      <p>If you too would like to explore the wonders of design and engineering, connect with me on Linkedin or Github (see footer). I would love to hear from you!</p>
